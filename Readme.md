n this project, we developed a system to predict Microsoft stock trading volume and closing prices using indicators like opening, high, and low prices. We segmented the data into distinct timeframes, applied Yeo-Johnson normalization to improve data quality, and modeled relationships using regression and LSTM models. To ensure accuracy, we assessed model performance with residual analysis. Finally, we built an interactive R Shiny app that allows users to input indicators and view predicted stock data through dynamic graphs.
